# CLM-19
FFAR-funded project with AFT + Regrow using OpTIS and DNDC model


Data analysis assumptions

## What are the current GHG emissions and C sequestration from corn-soybean agriculture in Illinois? Goal 2 (Laila)
We selected 2022 year and data from simulation 1
Variables to be analyzed N20 and CO2 in C equivalents
CH4 was almost zero and removed from analysis
We did the average between the two climate scenarios
We added the net impact as the balance between total N2O and DSCO in CO2 equivalents
Farmers C markets are expressed in CO2 eq

# Current GHG per SHMs
We selected 2022, and one climate scenario. Before 2022 is the spin up period for the model.
Fertilizer management was average across same CC, NT, RT and NC
We calculated the pure effect per management practices by comparing each systems. For example nt-cc; nt-nc. The differences between the two was average with the results of the other systems to address which system if NT or CC has a bigger effect.
