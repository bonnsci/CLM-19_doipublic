# OpTIS adoption rate information for Illinois aggregated by counties 2015-2021.
# Data shared with AFT from Regrow analysis.
# Column "kpi_name" gives different types of land use areas, with "area" meaning the 
# analyzed acres of the county, tillage type/ cover crop / etc.
# units are ACRES
# this code cleans up the data by: 
## 1) comparing acres evaluated by OpTIS in 2017 with the harvested cropland acres reported in 2017 Ag Census
## 2) removing counties where <50% of harvested cropland was evaluated by OpTIS
## 3) removing counties in the lowest fifth percentile of harvested cropland (small ag counties)
## 4) reports excluded counties
## 5) calculates percent adoption for CT, CC, NT, RT by year and mean adoption for 2018-2021
## 6) saves cleaned up data in new .csv files
